Philippine GTFS Data
====================

This is a [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference) feed containing jeepney, bus, and train data for Metro Manila. The data was released as part of the [Philippine Transit App Challenge](http://philippine-transit.hackathome.com/dataset-philippines-transit-information-service-gtfs/) which has since been concluded.

The data has been modified to better serve our app [Sakay](http://sakay.ph), for the original DOTC data, you can refer to the `dotc` branch.
